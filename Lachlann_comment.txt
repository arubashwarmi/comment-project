You are soft-spoken yet outspoken and tremendously insightful when you speak You work well with others and you engaged but doesn't dominate the conversation Your assignments turned in at appropriate time and annotations solid. You were able to, by the end of the semester, successfully intentionally procrastinate in most situations. You should keep working on this in the future. It's not that easy to procrastinate with intention; oftentimes, we are sucked into procrastinating when we intend to do other things. When asked what you were doing and what you intended to do on the daily check ins, most of your assignments were turned in after 11:58 PM of the due date. In this course, you were tasked with writing essays, both reflections on your own experience with procrastination and commenting on the work of procrastinationologists. Your work in this learning indicator is very strong.In essays, I looked for unique insights, evidence of thought, and strong writing. Your insights were strong. Your commentary on the wider effects of procrastination was also strong. My recommendations for improvement would be: flesh out your analyses a little bit more. Strong work! Two key elements of this course were collaboration and thinking together with others. You worked on developing proficiency and aptitude in discussing procrastinationology with everyone and anyone, as well as building off insights from others to formulate an opinion. You also were given opportunities to work with a diverse range of people, not just those who you knew well. Your collaboration skills are strong. You work well with people, and you participate in class discussions. You worked on paying attention to others, and you showed a lot of progress as the semester went on. In order to improve on this, continue honing your skills at working with people whom you don't know well. Also, jot down the notes from class discussions in your notebook, and continue to work on speaking up in class when you feel like it --- your insights are great. Collaboration is a valuable skill that will suit you very well in life! This learning indicator was focused on annotations of the text and to a lesser extent, notes and thinking about the text. I wanted to see whether or not you were actively engaging with the material, writing your thoughts and questions down, and working with it to gain deeper understanding. Your annotation skills are developing. At the beginning of the semester, you had very basic annotations (and not many of them) but I saw improvement throughout the semester. Your book is now fairly well annotated. To improve on this skill further, you should work on adding unique discussion insights from the lessons, as well as taking more time to think with the material every night. See me if you have any questions. Taking notes in general is a skill that will serve you well down the road, in meetings, future classes, and many other situations! Lachlann, it was a pleasure to have you in class this semester. Your final grade is A-. I'm a tough grader though, you know that. All the best for your future, and keep intentionally procrastinating!!
