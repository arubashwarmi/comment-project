You are focused and serious You participates occasionally in class discussions and you work best in pairs or small groups Your clear insights in class discussions and annotations are wonderful. You were able to, by the end of the semester, successfully intentionally procrastinate in most situations. You should keep working on this in the future. It's not that easy to procrastinate with intention; oftentimes, we are sucked into procrastinating when we intend to do other things. When asked what you were doing and what you intended to do on the daily check ins, most of your assignments were turned in after 11:58 PM of the due date. In this course, you were tasked with writing essays, both reflections on your own experience with procrastination and commenting on the work of procrastinationologists. Your work in this learning indicator is strong. In essays, I looked for unique insights, evidence of thought, and strong writing. Your insights were strong. Your commentary on the wider effects of procrastination was also strong. My recommendations for improvement would be: keep looking in the texts for the evidence that supports your unique insights. Also, think broadly and make connections across the different areas of procrastinationology and how it's applied in the real world, and really dig into your explanations and analysis. Strong work! Two key elements of this course were collaboration and thinking together with others. You worked on developing proficiency and aptitude in discussing procrastinationology with everyone and anyone, as well as building off insights from others to formulate an opinion. You also were given opportunities to work with a diverse range of people, not just those who you knew well. Your collaboration skills are strong, with room for improvement. You work well with some, and you participate occasionally in class discussions. You worked on paying attention to others, and you showed a lot of progress as the semester went on. In order to improve on this, go out of your way to greet and work with those whom you don't know well. Also, jot down the notes from class discussions in your notebook, and try to speak at least once per class in class discussions --- your insights are great. Collaboration is a valuable skill that will suit you very well in life! This learning indicator was focused on annotations of the text and to a lesser extent, notes and thinking about the text. I wanted to see whether or not you were actively engaging with the material, writing your thoughts and questions down, and working with it to gain deeper understanding. Your annotation skills are strong, with room for improvement. As the semester went on, I saw improvement in the quality and quantity of your annotations. Your book is well annotated. To improve on this skill further, you should work on adding unique discussion insights from the lessons, as well as underlining or circling vocabulary that you don't know. See me if you have any questions. Taking notes in general is a skill that will serve you well down the road, in meetings, future classes, and many other situations! Šebastián, it was a pleasure to have you in class this semester. Your final grade is B. I'm a tough grader though, you know that. All the best for your future, and keep intentionally procrastinating!!
